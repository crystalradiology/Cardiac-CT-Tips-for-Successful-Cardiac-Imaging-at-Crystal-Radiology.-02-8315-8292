Heart health is one of the most important aspects of overall wellbeing, and early detection of heart disease can be life-saving. With advances in medical imaging, Cardiac CT imaging has become a powerful, non-invasive way to assess the heart and coronary arteries. For patients across Australia, Cardiac CT Imaging at Crystal Radiology offers accurate, reliable insights that help doctors diagnose heart conditions early and guide effective treatment.
In this article, we’ll explain what cardiac CT imaging is, why it’s used, how to prepare for a successful scan, and why choosing Crystal Radiology makes a real difference to your heart care.
What is Cardiac CT Imaging?
Cardiac CT (Computed Tomography) imaging is an advanced diagnostic scan that uses X-rays and computer technology to create detailed images of the heart and surrounding blood vessels. Unlike traditional tests that may only suggest a problem, cardiac CT allows doctors to directly visualise the heart and coronary arteries.
At Cardiac CT Imaging at Crystal Radiology, this scan is commonly used to:
•	Detect plaque build-up in coronary arteries
•	Assess the risk of heart disease
•	Identify congenital heart abnormalities
•	Evaluate chest pain or unexplained symptoms
•	Guide further treatment or testing
The scan is fast, non-invasive, and provides highly detailed images that help doctors make informed decisions.
Why Cardiac CT Is Important for Heart Health
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of illness in Australia. Many people may not experience clear symptoms until the condition becomes serious. That’s where Cardiac CT Imaging at Crystal Radiology plays a crucial role.
Key benefits of cardiac CT imaging include:
•	Early detection of coronary artery disease
•	Accurate risk assessment for heart attacks
•	Reduced need for invasive procedures
•	Peace of mind for patients with a family history of heart disease
By identifying issues early, doctors can recommend lifestyle changes, medications, or further treatment before serious complications occur.
Types of Cardiac CT Scans
Depending on your symptoms and medical history, your doctor may refer you for different types of cardiac CT scans.
Common cardiac CT scans include:
•	Calcium scoring CT – measures calcium build-up in the coronary arteries
•	CT coronary angiography (CTCA) – visualises blood flow and blockages
•	Cardiac structural assessment – checks heart chambers and vessels
Each scan performed at Cardiac CT Imaging at Crystal Radiology is tailored to your clinical needs, ensuring accurate and meaningful results.
Tips to prepare for your cardiac CT:
•	Avoid caffeine for at least 12–24 hours before the scan
•	Do not eat for 4–6 hours prior (unless advised otherwise)
•	Take prescribed medications as directed by your doctor
•	Wear comfortable clothing and avoid metal accessories
•	Inform staff about allergies, kidney issues, or pregnancy
At Cardiac CT Imaging at Crystal Radiology, the team will guide you through each step to ensure you feel comfortable and well-prepared.
The Benefits: Why This Scan is a Game-Changer
Traditional stress tests only detect blockages when they reach about 70% or more. A Cardiac CT can find "soft plaque" earlier, allowing for preventative lifestyle changes or medication long before a crisis occurs.
•	Non-Invasive: No recovery time; you can drive yourself home.
•	High Accuracy: 91–95% accuracy in ruling out significant coronary artery disease.
•	Speed: Results are typically processed and sent to your GP within 24–48 hours.
Affordable Heart Care: Medicare and Bulk Billing
In Australia, the cost of advanced imaging can be a concern for many families. Fortunately, Cardiac Ct Imaging at Crystal Radiology is often available through bulk billing for eligible patients with a specialist referral. This means you can receive world-class diagnostic care with no out-of-pocket expenses, provided you meet the Medicare criteria.
•	Check with your GP: Ensure your referral is from a specialist (like a Cardiologist) if you are seeking a Medicare rebate for a CTCA.
•	Accessibility: With locations across NSW and WA (including Auburn, Harris Park, and Butler), getting a high-quality heart scan has never been easier for Australians.
Conclusion: Take Control of Your Heart Health
Your heart is the engine of your life. Don't leave its health to chance or wait for symptoms like chest pain to emerge. By following the preparation tips mentioned above, you ensure that your medical team gets the most accurate data possible to guide your treatment.
